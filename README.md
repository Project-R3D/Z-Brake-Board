This repository acts as a backup to that original design (which was sadly removed from all other Lulzbot servers) while complying with the original `CC BY SA 4.0` license. The GPL license file has even been kept intact even though there is no software contained within and it doesn't really apply - everything should already be covered by the CC license.
